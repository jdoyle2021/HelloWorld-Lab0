# HelloWorld-Lab0
This repository is for the Lab 0 assignment in COT 5930 at FAU. It is simply an introductory assignment to familiarize us with the systems we will be using and the methodologies we will be following in this course in the future.

(as per the Git hub "Hello World" tutorial) A bit about myself is that I am a graduate student in my final semester of graduate school and I am really interested in learning the contents of this course. Many of the courses I have taken feel like there is a venn diagram overlap that sometimes is basically a circle so I am really looking forward to learning something entirely new, even if it is a struggle for me and I will likely be very bad at it initially.
